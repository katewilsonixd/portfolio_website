        <h2>Urban Design Challenge.</h2> 
 
        <img src="images/3x/1x/Handw.png"  alt="urban design concept">
        <p> A group project created by myself, Caireann Mcelligott and Jiajian Chen, as part of Belfast Design Week 2019.</p>
        
        <p>Skills: User Research, Surveying, Field- Research, Working in a multidisciplinary team, Pitching to a client. </p>
        <br>
            
        <h3>The Brief.</h3>
        <p> 
        The Brief for the Urban Design Challenge was to turn the empty 'space' within the Smithfield Market and Union area of Belfast City Centre into a welcoming 'place'.
        
        </p>
       <br>
            
        <h3>Discover.</h3>    
        <p> To start out we thought about what our own individual perceptions of the area were.From this we were able to ask the question - "Why do we perceive the area this way?" and How can we change it.</p>

        <p> We went outside. The most important part of this project was the feedback given by the local communities. It became apparent through talking to a lot of young families that there was a lack of safe, child-friendly outdoor space. It was also interesting to hear from several students that they only wallked up North Street because their "bus stopped there." </p> 
            <br>
        <h3>Define.</h3>
        <p> We tried to section the project into themes which we wished to address. Using post-it notes we organised our ideas into four main categories, Movement, Safety, Miss-used Architectural Assets, and Demographics.</p>

        <h3>Develop</h3>
        
        <p> We identified that the main theme to address was connections. The design concept would connect the city-centre, Ulster University and West Belfast. 
        An outdoor green-space at the North Street car-park and bus-stop, will create a central connecting point in the middle of the key areas.</p>

        <h3>Deliver.</h3>
        <p> We created an outdoor space titled "The Pocket Park Plus".  An Outdoor space which incorporates all age groups, from the elderly to young families, and students.</p>
